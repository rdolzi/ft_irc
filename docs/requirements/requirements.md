# Requirements

- Create an IRC server in C++ 98.
- Do not develop a client.
- Do not handle server-to-server communication.
- The program should be named "ircserv" and take two arguments: port number and connection password.
- It must handle multiple clients simultaneously without hanging.
- Forking is not allowed. All I/O operations must be non-blocking.
- Only one poll() (or equivalent like select(), kqueue(), epoll()) can be used - for handling all operations.
- Communication between client and server must use TCP/IP (v4 or v6).
- The server must support basic IRC functionalities:
    - Authentication
    - Setting nickname and username
    - Joining channels
    - Sending and receiving private messages
    - Forwarding messages in channels to all members
- Implement operator and regular user roles.
- Implement specific channel operator commands: KICK, INVITE, TOPIC, and MODE.
- The code must compile with flags -Wall -Wextra -Werror and comply with C++98 standard.
- External libraries and Boost libraries are forbidden.
- A Makefile must be provided with rules for NAME, all, clean, fclean, and re.
- The program should not crash under any circumstances.
- The server should be tested with a chosen reference IRC client, which must connect without errors.
- File transfer and a bot (bonus part).
