## Conclusion

These RFCs collectively form the complete specification of the IRC protocol. When implementing an IRC server, RFC 2812 (Client Protocol) should be the primary reference, supplemented by RFC 2811 for channel management details. The other RFCs provide valuable context and information about the broader IRC ecosystem.

It's worth noting that while these RFCs define the standard, many IRC networks and clients have implemented various extensions and modifications to the protocol over the years. Some of these extensions have become de facto standards in the IRC community, despite not being officially documented in RFCs.

When working on an IRC server implementation, it's advisable to start with strict adherence to these RFCs, particularly 2811 and 2812, and then consider adding widely-accepted extensions as needed for compatibility with modern IRC clients and networks.
